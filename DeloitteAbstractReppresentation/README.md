# Deloitte_Abstract_Reppresentation_ABM

An agent-based model (ABM) of Deloitte. This is a theoretical representation of the underlying properties of a consulting firm and provides the opportunity to run Scenario Analysis simulations of the consulting firm. (Java) (Simudyne SDK)

A fully detailed explenation about the functionality oe each class can be seen in my report. 

**IMPORTANT: **
Due to the limitations of my computer, the links between consulting agents was temporarily commente out, such that it would be possible to run the model with 5000+ employees. As there would be more than 25+million links saved. 

If you are utilizing a very powerfull Tower Pc you could atempt to run the full model, or alternaively you wish to run the model with much fewer agents, then you can uncoment the following lines:

In the SimpleFirmModel, the lines to uncoment are:
179 - 186
This is the consultant links initialization

& 

In the SuperConsultant, the lines to uncoment are: 
141-146
These lines of code are responsible for linking the new consultants which where just spawned. 

_Running the model:_

Please run the model directly thought the Deloitte_Abstract_Reppresentation_ABM, in order to limit potential root errors. 
Also a running version of Simudyne SDK is neccessay to run the code.
